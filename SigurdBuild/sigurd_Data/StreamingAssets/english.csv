Dialog1.1;â€¦
Dialog1.2;Sigurd... Sigurd... Wake up.
Dialog1.3;Leave me. I'm already dead.
Dialog1.4;The fight isn't over yet.
Dialog2.1;It seems that the exit is behind this fence although the gate doesn't seem to give way.
Dialog2.2;With a little more power I'll be able to open it.
Dialog2.3;What are you insinuating?
Dialog2.4;If you manage to find some traces of my energy I might regain my powers.
Dialog2.5;"And where exactly are these ""traces"" you speak of?"
Dialog2.6;There are chests all over Yggdrasil. The Aesir made sure to seal me a long time ago.
Dialog2.7;Then we have a common enemy. I'm with you.
Dialog3.1;Who are you? Aren't you going to attack me?
Dialog3.2;My name is Hela and I am the Aesir who rules Helheim.
Dialog3.3;An Aesir? Then I'll have to defeat you.
Dialog3.4;Wait! I see that you have a connection to the Omen. I'm going to help you. I've opened the castle gates so you can escape.
Dialog3.5;And why are you helping me then?
Dialog3.6;I have my reasons.
